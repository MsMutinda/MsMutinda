### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Juliet Mutinda. I am a growing _fullstack developer_. I love working with python/Django and data manipulation technologies like pandas, matplotlib and beautiful soup, just to mention a few. I have worked on a few projects so far that include the use of technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and PHP.


Here's what's up with me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting to know the Laravel framework's ins and outs better.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Js and technical writing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source or other projects that can help me be an amazing developer.
