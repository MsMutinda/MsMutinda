### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹


My name is Juliet Mutinda, a _fullstack developer_. I have practical experience in the use of web frameworks such as laravel, .NET, & django, and technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.


Here's what's up with me:

- ðŸ”­ I am always working on improving my skills by building projects that can help with getting to learn the ins and outs of a concept better.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning React and Node Js.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source or other projects that can help me continue growing into an amazing developer.
