Hello, and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am Juliet Mutinda, a seasoned full-stack developer with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and user-centric web applications. I possess extensive experience in building with frameworks such as .NET, Next.js, and NestJS, and have a keen interest in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to deliver high-quality solutions.

A few things about me:

ðŸ”­ I'm continually refining my skills through complex projects that push my technical boundaries and help me in optimizing performance and building robust, enterprise-grade applications.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaborating on open-source projects and innovative initiatives that foster growth and drive impactful change in the tech community.

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying movies, listening to music, or getting lost in a good book.
